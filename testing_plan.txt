The coding was devided into 2 parts:
 1) Get it working but whitout a xml request for part a. Just one to read
    the file and display it in a text box 
 2) Make the request to post a message in the file be an xml request and save it on repository 

The repository allowed the liberty to change functions in the code without losing al the job that was done, 
 it is, I modified lines and function to compare and see how the program would correspond to the changes. I testes :
    - if more than one request is sent 
    - if the user tries to type on the post area directly and not in the input text area 
    - Change a line of code so the post fail, to check if a message is posted when it happens 

The time to process a single pot is very small (~ 44 ms- as inspect showed). The size of the date can have a impact, but as
  the data sent was just ascii characters the impact isn't that great.

If two request is sent, they will be processed in order, as it is asynchronous calls the first one will be processed and the second one
  will be set in a waiting list. The program will continue receiving calls, after one of the calls are finished the second one will be called 
  back. There is no waiting time for the user, and both are posted almost at the same time.
