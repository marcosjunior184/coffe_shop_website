D)

The coding was devided into 3 parts:
 1) Set a new database in mysql called "mydb" and set a table post with (Topic, Data, Timestamp)
 2) Set up a html file that would display the data from mysql and let user have some choices
 3) Set up post methods to set data in the mydb and display it in the order the user desires

The repository allowed the liberty to change functions in the code without losing al the job that was done, 
 it is, I modified lines and function to compare and see how the program would correspond to the changes. I tested :
    - if more than one request is sent 
    - if diffent pages have different preferences in listing the data from database (order them differently)
    - Chek if the posting in a page with different data order would be posted and sorted accordingly to user preference in another page
      (it is if the pages have different preference to display the data)
    - Use wolf-fancing to track data accross the system ensuring that the right data is being sent and received
    - Select different order to display the posting and manually check if they were indeed in order
    - Wright to the database entries that should modify the order in the posting area and check if the result was the expected one
